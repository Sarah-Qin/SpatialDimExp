\title{Generate three dimensional geographical data.}
\usage{
GenerateData(n, SimRep, trueTheta)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{The number of locations.}

\item{SimRep}{The number of realizations of the Gaussian process \eqn{Y(X)}.}

\item{trueTheta}{A given positive value that controls the correlation of the spatial random process.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
 \item LocIndex: three dimensional location coordinates;
 \item YObs: realizations of the Gaussian process \eqn{Y(X)};
 \item SigmaObs: covariance matrix of the random process \eqn{Y(X)}.
}
}
\description{
The spatial random process \eqn{Y(X)} follows a Gaussian process.
The locations coordinates are simulated on a three-dimensional half-ellipsoid
centered at (0,0,0) and the projection of the first two dimensions
is a disk centered at the origin.
